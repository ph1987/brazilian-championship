# Brazilian Championship

Application created as task of postgraduate course.
This application consumes an API that returns brazilian football data.
I organized all this data and returned the classification at the end of the championship for each year.
To implement this solution, I used the technologies below:

- React
- NextJS
- TypeScript
- React Hooks
- SWR
- Material UI
- Tailwind

API Source: https://brasileirao-backend-phl.glitch.me/

Year can be a number between: 2003-2015
